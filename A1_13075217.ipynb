        "In the past years, extended researches were conducted in the field of face recognition. In an early work, Bledsoe mentioned about a system with a human operator who locates the feature points of human face and manually enters the position to the system. So, when the point distance of the features of an unfamiliar person is provided the test face is identified using some classification techniques like nearest neighbours (Sakthivel 2010). Remarkable progress has achieved in the field of face recognition with the development of potent models for face recognition. Through these models the faces can be represented as points in a high dimensional image space and then dimensionality reduction is used to get a meaningful picture. Two famous techniques used for dimensionality reduction are Principal component analysis(PCA) and Fishers Linear Discriminant Analysis(Fisher-LDA)(Kak 2001). Even though PCA is ideal for remaking images from a low dimensional space, since it withholds undesired changes due to the variation resulted by change in light and facial expression it is not good from a discrimination viewpoint. Fishers linear discriminant (FLD), proposed by Robert Fisher in 1936 is a traditional technique used in pattern classification. Several researchers used fisher’s discriminator in developing new methods for face recognition. \n",
        "The drawbacks with early developed methods was face recognition was only possible with the condition of small variation in lighting and facial expression but using the proposed strategy Fisherfaces which is a derivative of ‘Fisher’s Linear Discriminant’(FLD), it is possible to identify faces even with cases of extreme variations.\n",
