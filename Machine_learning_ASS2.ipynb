As a result the information that is shared through social media can affect a potential consumer’s decision to make a purchase. Social media promotes interaction, coordination as well as sharing of content (Palmer & Koenig-Lewis, 2009). This can be through blogs, social network platforms as well as review websites. Such sites can also be used to promote brands such as Pinterest. The information that is shared in the Internet about different opinions of users about products can be utilised by firms to evaluate the general feedback of the users to further improve their offerings and more over ensure a higher customer satisfaction.\n",
